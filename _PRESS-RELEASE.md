There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Goonies BackPacker App

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  Individuals looking to plan a hiking route in Yosemite. Users can set their route on a map and see instant data on distance, elevation, estimated duration, estimated water required, and estimated calories required.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  Planning to hike can be inconvenient at best and dangerous at worst. Newcomers may not know what to expect, and experienced backpackers are constantly struggling to pack just right for long and strenuous journeys. The Goonies backpacking app makes route planning easy and gives you instant estimates for duration and water/food needs, giving you the confidence you need to spend less time planning and more time hiking!

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  Selecting hiking routes and planning accordingly can be a tedious task for new and experienced hikers alike. An informed decision requires knowing distance and elevation so that often inaccurate estimations can be made for how long it will take and how much water and food needs to be carried in. Hikers usually pick new routes, so these estimations are a recurring challenge, and given the circumstance, can be dangerous if incorrect!

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  The Goonies Backpacking App addresses these needs by offering a simple map on which hikers can drop pins to set a route, and see instant estimates for calories needed, water needed, and duration based on distance and elevation changes of their route.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "Our backpacker app is the perfect mix between convenience and safety - we take the hassle out of planning and give you confidence you're prepared!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Visit our app at www.goonies.heroku.com to sign up and start planning your Yosemite route!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

   "I use Goonies for absolutely every trip. It's simple route planning tool and instant feedback cuts the planning trip in half, and I never end up carrying too much or too little." -- experienced backpacker
