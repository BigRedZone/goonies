  Goonies BackPacker App

## Sub-Heading ##

  Individuals looking to plan a hiking route in Yosemite. Users can set their route on a map and see instant data on distance, elevation, estimated duration, estimated water required, and estimated calories required.

## Summary ##

  Planning to hike can be inconvenient at best and dangerous at worst. Newcomers may not know what to expect, and experienced backpackers are constantly struggling to pack just right for long and strenuous journeys. The Goonies backpacking app makes route planning easy and gives you instant estimates for duration and water/food needs, giving you the confidence you need to spend less time planning and more time hiking! The initial release is limited to Yosemite National Park in the US.

## Problem ##

  Selecting hiking routes and planning accordingly can be a tedious task for new and experienced hikers alike. An informed decision requires knowing distance and elevation so that often inaccurate estimations can be made for how long it will take and how much water and food needs to be carried in. Hikers usually pick new routes, so these estimations are a recurring challenge, and given the circumstance, can be dangerous if incorrect!

## Solution ##

  The Goonies Backpacking App addresses these needs by offering a simple map on which hikers can drop pins to set a route, and see instant estimates for calories needed, water needed, and duration based on distance and elevation changes of their route.
